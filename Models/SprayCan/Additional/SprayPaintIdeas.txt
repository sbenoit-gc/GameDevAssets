RenderTarget idea

You're right, let's break down the render target drawing approach in Blueprints.  It's a bit more involved than decals, but definitely achievable.

1. Create Render Target:

    In the Content Browser, right-click -> "Render Target." Name it RT_SprayPaint.
    Open RT_SprayPaint. Set the desired resolution (e.g., 512x512, adjust as needed). Choose a format that supports an alpha channel (e.g., PF_B8G8R8A8).

2. Create Material (for the painted surface):

    Create a new material (e.g., M_SprayPaintSurface).
    Add a "Texture Sample" node. Select RT_SprayPaint as the texture.
    Connect the Texture Sample's output to the "Base Color" of the Material Output.
    Apply M_SprayPaintSurface to the plane mesh in your level.

3. Create Material (for the spray paint blob):

    Create a simple material (e.g., M_SprayPaintBlob). This can be a constant color or a texture. If you want a soft spray paint blob, you can use a radial gradient texture.

4. Blueprint Logic (Spray Paint):

    Event Tick (or Custom Event): This will be called repeatedly while spraying.
    Line Trace: Perform your line trace.
    Branch: Check if the line trace hit something.
    Get Hit Actor: Get the actor that was hit.
    Get Mesh Component: Get the mesh component of the hit actor.
    Get Render Target: Get the RT_SprayPaint render target.
    Get Render Target Draw Canvas: Use this node, passing in your render target.
    Convert World to Local:
        Get the hit location (Impact Point from the line trace).
        Get the transform of the mesh component.
        Use the "Inverse Transform Location" node to convert the hit location from world space to the mesh's local space.
    Convert Local to UV:
        Get the bounding box of the mesh using the "Get Actor Bounds" node, and from the returned struct, use the "Max" vector.
        Divide the local hit location's X and Y components by the Max X and Y of the bounding box, respectively. This gives you normalized UV coordinates (0-1 range).
        Important: Depending on your mesh's UV mapping, you might need to adjust or flip these UV coordinates.
    Draw Material:
        Canvas: Connect the canvas from "Get Render Target Draw Canvas."
        Material: Use your M_SprayPaintBlob material.
        Location: Connect the converted UV coordinates. Multiply the UV coordinates by the render target resolution to get the correct pixel coordinates on the render target.
        Size: Set the size of your spray paint blob (in pixels on the render target).
    Update Render Target: Use this node after drawing.

5. Continuous Spraying:

    Use a "Boolean Variable" to track if the spray trigger is held.
    Use a "Branch" node to control the execution of the drawing logic based on the trigger state.

Key Blueprint Nodes:

    Get Render Target Draw Canvas
    Draw Material
    Update Render Target
    Line Trace by Channel
    Branch
    Get Hit Actor
    Get Mesh Component
    Inverse Transform Location
    Get Actor Bounds
    Divide (Vector or Float)
    Make Vector 2D (if needed)

Important Considerations:

    UV Mapping: The UV conversion is the most crucial part. Experiment with different ways to manipulate the UV coordinates if the drawing isn't aligned correctly. Print the UV coordinates to the screen to verify they are in the correct range.
    Performance: Drawing on a render target can be more efficient than decals, but it's still important to optimize. Use a reasonable render target resolution, avoid overdraw, and consider using a pooling system for your spray paint blob materials if you have a high rate of fire.
    Blending: If you need the spray paint to blend with the underlying surface, you'll need to handle the blending in your M_SprayPaintSurface material.
    Clearing: Use the "Clear Render Target" node to reset the drawing if needed.


You are absolutely correct! My apologies; I seem to be mixing up some terminology and concepts between Unreal Engine and Unity.  I'll focus specifically on Unreal Engine and Blueprints from now on.

Let's refine the simplified approach for a spray paint can in VR using Unreal Engine and Blueprints:

Simplified Approach (Unreal Engine/Blueprints):

    Spray Paint Blob Material (M_SprayPaintBlob):
        Create a new Material.
        For a simple blob, use a "Constant3Vector" node for color. You can also use a "Radial Gradient" node connected to a "Lerp" node to create a softer blob.
        Connect the output to the "Base Color."

    Render Target Setup:
        Create a Render Target (RT_SprayPaint). Set the desired resolution (e.g., 512x512). Choose a format with alpha (e.g., PF_B8G8R8A8).
        Create a Material (M_SprayPaintSurface). Add a "Texture Sample" node, select RT_SprayPaint, and connect it to "Base Color."

    VR Interaction:
        In your character Blueprint (or wherever you handle VR input):
            Use the "Motion Controller (L/R) Component" nodes to get hand tracking data.
            Use an "Input Action" event (e.g., "Spray") to trigger the spraying.

    Blueprint Logic:
        On "Spray" Input Action Pressed: Set a "Spraying" boolean variable to true.
        On "Spray" Input Action Released: Set "Spraying" to false.
        Event Tick:
            Branch on "Spraying."
            If True:
                Get Hand Location and Rotation: Use "Get World Location" and "Get World Rotation" from your Motion Controller Component.
                Line Trace: Use "Line Trace by Channel" from the hand location forward (using the hand's forward vector).
                Branch on Line Trace Hit:
                    If True:
                        Get Hit Location: From the "Break Hit Result" node.
                        Get Hit Actor and Mesh: From the "Break Hit Result" node.
                        Convert World to Local: Use "Inverse Transform Location" on the hit actor's transform.
                        Get Actor Bounds: From the hit actor.
                        Convert Local to UV: Divide the local hit location X and Y by the Max X and Y of the bounds (adjust as needed).
                        Get Render Target Draw Canvas: Use RT_SprayPaint.
                        Draw Material:
                            Canvas: From "Get Render Target Draw Canvas."
                            Material: M_SprayPaintBlob.
                            Location: Multiply the UV coordinates by the RT_SprayPaint resolution (use "Get Render Target Size").
                            Size: Set the desired blob size (in pixels).
                        Update Render Target.

Key Improvements and Clarifications:

    Unreal Engine Nodes: I've used the correct Unreal Engine Blueprint node names.
    Hand Tracking: Using "Motion Controller Component" for VR hand tracking.
    Input Action: Using an "Input Action" for the spray trigger.
    Local to UV Conversion: Clarified the steps and nodes involved, including "Inverse Transform Location" and "Get Actor Bounds."
    Render Target Size: Using "Get Render Target Size" to get the correct resolution for drawing.

Steps to Get Started (Unreal Engine/Blueprints):

    Create the materials (M_SprayPaintBlob, M_SprayPaintSurface).
    Set up the render target (RT_SprayPaint).
    Apply M_SprayPaintSurface to your target surface.
    Set up VR hand tracking and the "Spray" Input Action.
    Implement the Blueprint logic described above.

Troubleshooting Tips:

    Print String: Use "Print String" to debug the UV coordinates. Make sure they are in the 0-1 range.
    VR Preview: Test frequently in VR Preview.
    Material: Double-check your materials.

This refined approach should be much more accurate and helpful for your Unreal Engine/Blueprint VR spray paint can.  Let me know if you have any more questions!


While there isn't one single perfect tutorial that covers all aspects of a VR spray paint can in Unreal Engine Blueprints, I can point you to some helpful resources that address the key components:

1. VR Interaction (Hand Tracking and Input):

    Unreal Engine's Official VR Documentation: This is the best place to start. Search for "VR," "Motion Controllers," and "Input Actions." The official documentation often has example Blueprints and explanations.
    YouTube Tutorials (VR Hand Tracking): Search YouTube for "Unreal Engine VR Hand Tracking" or "Unreal Engine Motion Controllers." Many tutorials cover setting up hand tracking and using input actions for VR interactions.

2. Line Tracing in Blueprints:

    Unreal Engine Documentation (Line Trace): Search for "Line Trace by Channel" in the documentation.
    YouTube Tutorials (Line Trace): Search for "Unreal Engine Blueprint Line Trace." There are numerous tutorials on how to perform line traces in Blueprints.

3. Render Targets and Drawing in Blueprints:

    Unreal Engine Documentation (Render Targets): Search for "Render Targets" and "Drawing to Render Targets."
    YouTube Tutorials (Render Targets): Search for "Unreal Engine Draw to Render Target" or "Unreal Engine Dynamic Render Target." These tutorials will show you how to draw on a render target in Blueprints.

4. Material Creation (for Render Target and Blob):

    Unreal Engine Documentation (Materials): Search for "Materials" and "Material Editor."
    YouTube Tutorials (Materials): Search for "Unreal Engine Material Tutorial." Focus on tutorials covering textures, constant vectors, and basic material properties.

5. UV Coordinate Conversion:

    This is the trickiest part, and unfortunately, there aren't many dedicated tutorials specifically for this in a VR context. The core concept is to convert the 3D world space hit location to 2D UV coordinates on the render target. The key nodes are "Inverse Transform Location" (to get the hit location in the target mesh's local space) and "Get Actor Bounds" (to get the size of the mesh). You then divide the local hit location components by the corresponding bounds dimensions. This gives you a 0-1 range that can be used as UVs. Experimentation and printing the UV values to the screen for debugging are essential here.

6. Combining the Pieces:

    This is where you'll need to use your problem-solving skills. Take the knowledge from the individual tutorials and combine them to create the spray paint effect. The simplified approach I outlined in the previous response is a good starting point.

Tips for Finding Helpful Tutorials:

    Be Specific: Use very specific keywords in your searches (e.g., "Unreal Engine VR Hand Tracking Line Trace Render Target").
    Look for UE5 Tutorials: Prioritize tutorials made for Unreal Engine 5, as older tutorials might use outdated nodes or techniques.
    Check the Dates: Look for recent tutorials, as Unreal Engine's features and best practices can change over time.

If you get stuck on a specific part:

    Unreal Engine Forums: Ask for help on the Unreal Engine forums. Be sure to provide as much detail as possible, including screenshots of your Blueprints and materials.
    Community Resources: Look for Unreal Engine communities on Discord or other platforms.

While a single "spray paint can" tutorial might not exist, by combining the knowledge from these various resources, you should be able to implement the effect.  Remember to start simple, test frequently, and break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.




This Blueprint setup should allow you to draw on a render target for your spray paint effect.  Remember that the UV conversion might require some tweaking depending on your specific mesh and UV mapping.  Don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions!
